## The problem it solves
Type 1 diabetes affects 9 million people worldwide. Among them 24% forget their medication at least once in 14 days. Forgetting to take the insulin dose can quickly lead to serious problems like blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, and even death. To resolve this, our project idea is the Sathi app. Like a reliable friend, the app will send personalized reminder notifications for the patient to take their medications in time and update their glucometer readings. It will give suggestions about when to measure the blood sugar level. If the patient misses the notification, the app will notify their trusted person. Similarly, if their sugar level is very high, the app will send alert messages to the doctor. In type 1 diabetes, one missed dose of insulin can create a life and death situation so, through this project, we want to prevent that from happening and make their life easier.
